## Disclaimer ##
As you can tell, the quality of the code isnt perfect, or to a particular standard. Once the plugin works properly to a basic level, I will install some linting software to make the code look nicer, and hopefully run smoother too.

All the time the app has a version of `0.0.0`, the extensions are considered to be unstable and unlikely to work properly, if at all.

## Example ##
The sytax used is identical to what is used in the hipchat applications: wrapping the identifier in brackets `()`. For example, (yey) (allthethings) .

## Building for yourself ##
Whilst I recommend that you use the plugins that are on the add-on stores of the respective browsers, building the apps yourself is perfectly possible. I build the apps on ubuntu, so have made sure that the build scripts work for me, use on other platforms may vary.
### Commands: ###
    npm clean
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run build-extensions



### To-Do ###
* Create chrome version
* Create script to copy files from common to platform directories
* Add other sites support (currently facebook messages popup only)


##### Disclaimer: #####
As you can tell, the quality of the code isnt perfect, or to a particular standard. Once the plugin works properly to a basic level, I will install some linting software to make the code look nicer, and possibly run smoother too.

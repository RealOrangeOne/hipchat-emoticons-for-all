## Disclaimer ##
All the time the app has a version of `0.0.0`, the extensions are considered to be unstable and unlikely to work properly, if at all.

## Example ##
The sytax used is identical to what is used in the hipchat applications: wrapping the identifier in brackets `()`. For example, (yey) (allthethings) (boom) .
